- [ ] Buzzer feedback remained correct.
- [ ] iPhone discovery/connection/synchronization observation recorded below.
- [ ] Disconnect/reconnect and advertising restart observation recorded below.
- [ ] Journal/result observation recorded below.
- [ ] Production firmware was restored after diagnostics.

## Measurements

| Measurement | Value | How observed |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Idle free heap | not measured | |
| Connected free heap | not measured | |
| Transfer minimum free heap | not measured | |
| Negotiated ATT MTU/value bytes | not measured | |
| Logical response bytes/time | not measured | |
| Watchdog or reset count | not measured | |
| Whole-device USB current | not measured | |

## Notes

Rejected diagnostic run. With the main stack raised to 49 KiB, the controller
initialized the OLED and then reported a main-task stack-protection fault while
opening persistent stores. Disassembly identified the large
`PersistentJournal::initialize` frame. This is negative debugging evidence.
